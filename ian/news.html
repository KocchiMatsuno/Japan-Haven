					After being closed to tourists for two years, Japan is opening its borders to visitors from 98 countries and regions.
					It marks the most significant moment so far in the country's slow relaxation of its Covid-19 entry restrictions.
					But some restrictions will remain, including a requirement to visit the country as part of a tour group.
					Japan implemented some of the world's toughest virus control regimes, and banned foreign visitors from the delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.
					Travel restrictions had already been relaxed for foreign residents and business travellers, and the government recently raised the limit on 
					daily foreign arrivals to 20,000 from 1 June. 
					<br>
					<br>
					The decision comes after the government last week said it would test allowing small group tours 
					with visitors from the United States, Australia, Thailand and Singapore from this month.
					On Thursday, the government revised border controls to resume accepting package tours from 36 countries and regions where the COVID-19 situation 
					is relatively stable, it said in a statement.
					The countries include Britain, Spain, Canada, Saudi Arabia, and Malaysia.
					Japan will also expand the number of airports that accept international flights to seven, adding Naha in its southern Okinawa prefecture and 
					Chitose near Sapporo in northern Hokkaido.
